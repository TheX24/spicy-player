/**
 * Port of the reference's position pipeline (`spicy-lyrics/src/utils/Gets/GetProgress.ts`):
 * a smooth playback clock built in two stages, exactly like the original.
 *
 * **Stage 1 — anchor extrapolation** (the reference's `Position + (Date.now() - StartedSyncAt)`):
 * the raw player position is only trusted as an *anchor*; between changes it is extrapolated
 * on wall-clock time. This is essential — if the platform position steps coarsely (e.g. a
 * `MediaController` that refreshes over IPC), feeding it raw into a smoother makes the
 * predicted clock rubber-band and eventually *snap* (the sweep visibly jumping to complete).
 * Anchoring makes the measured signal itself continuous first.
 *
 * **Stage 2 — jitter filter** (`normalizeProgress`): a predicted clock advancing on wall-clock
 * time, pulled toward the extrapolated measurement with a frame-rate-independent low-pass
 * (`alpha = 1 − exp(−elapsed / 300ms)`); deltas above 500ms (seeks, track changes) snap.
 *
 * While paused the clock returns the raw measured position and forgets its state; while
 * playing a fixed +100ms lead compensates audio-output latency (the reference's dial).
