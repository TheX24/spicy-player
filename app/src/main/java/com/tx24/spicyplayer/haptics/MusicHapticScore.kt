/**
 * Turns a song's audio analysis into the vibrations that play along with it.

 * [MusicHapticsStyle.Drums] feels what is played, from the song's [Rhythm]. A snare, a clap or an
 * acoustic kick starts a sound in nearly every frequency band at once, where a bass note or a
 * hi-hat starts one in a band or two, so the hits reaching most bands are drums, on the beat or off
 * it, and the more bands the harder. Each is a kick or a snare by its timbre against the hits
 * around it: a snare or clap sounds brighter than the kick. Most produced kicks (an 808, say) only
 * reach the lowest band, like the bass does; in a section with drums whose downbeats aren't
 * full-band hits, the kick must be one of those, so the loud, sharp onsets in the lowest band are
 * taken for it, and they join the hits the full-band ones are compared with (so a clap among 808s
 * sounds as snary as it is). Sections without full-band drum hits follow
 * the notes instead, lightly, from the smaller onsets: a piano's low notes are no kick. A song with
 * no rhythm in its analysis gets the steady beat.
 *
 * Judged one by one, a hit near a threshold lands on a different side of it from bar to bar, and
 * a groove that repeats would flicker. So each drum section is then played as its groove: what is
 * hit on a sixteenth in most of its bars is played in every bar, as a kick or a snare by what it
 * is most often, at its usual strength, wherever the audio has a sound there ([grooves]).
 *
 * [MusicHapticsStyle.Beat] is a steady pulse: every beat, firmer on each bar's first.
 *
 * Both mark drops (a section that comes in much louder than the one before, with a swell into the
 * bigger ones) and big hits, and both follow the loudness: quiet parts are faint, silence still.
