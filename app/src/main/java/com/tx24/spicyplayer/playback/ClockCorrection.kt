     * sound. So a pause report behind a clock that was in step is not believed: the clock keeps its

     * clock: YouTube Music keeps counting from its stale sample after resuming, while the audio
     * carries on from where it really was; KDE Connect is right again on resume; and either may
     * correct itself later. A report that fits neither is a seek, and drops the bias.
